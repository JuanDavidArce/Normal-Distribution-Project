# Normal Distribution Project
With this project we intend to perform some operations that allow us a normal distribution, such as finding the probability below and above an x, find the probability between x1 and x2, typify, find probabilities of a standard normal distribution N ( 0.1) etc.

# Important
In order to execute the file we must have the scipy, numpy and matplotlib module installed, if we do not have them installed we can execute the installer.bat file
